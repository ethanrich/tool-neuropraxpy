function trans = createRotationOx(varargin)
%CREATEROTATIONOX Create the 4x4 matrix of a 3D rotation around x-axis.
%
%   TRANS = createRotationOx(THETA);
%   Returns the transform matrix corresponding to a rotation by the angle
%   THETA (in radians) around the Ox axis. A rotation by an angle of PI/2
%   would transform the vector [0 1 0] into the vector [0 0 1].
%
%   The returned matrix has the form:
%   [1      0            0      0]
%   [0  cos(THETA) -sin(THETA)  0]
%   [0  sin(THETA)  cos(THETA)  0]
%   [0      0            0      1]
%
%   TRANS = createRotationOx(ORIGIN, THETA);
%   TRANS = createRotationOx(X0, Y0, Z0, THETA);
%   Also specifies origin of rotation. The result is similar as performing
%   translation(-X0, -Y0, -Z0), rotation, and translation(X0, Y0, Z0).
